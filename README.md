About the game
==============
Mortal-Kombat-C is a small personal project based on the famous videogame. 
It was written in C using the SDL library.
The game was developed in short time, therefore there are no more complex features such as combos.

There are two gameplay videos on Youtube:

- Sub-Zero Wins: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBcC8bPsrLQ
